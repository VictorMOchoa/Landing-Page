## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Dev

To develop this project, I utilized a few concepts covered in the second module of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree

* ES6 arrow functions

* Working with the DOM

* Dynamically adding elements to the DOM

* Using querySelector and getElementById

* Working with eventListeners
